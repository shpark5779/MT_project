## Intro
1. For image preprocessing, crop the images using the largest square box.
2. Use the Xception model and binary cross-entropy loss function since it's a binary classification.
3. Utilize the optimizers AdamW and AdaBelief, along with the traditional Adam optimizer.
4. Pretrain using an open dataset similar to the current colonoscopy dataset.
